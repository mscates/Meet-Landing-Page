### Built with

- SASS
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to use nesting with sass and I added a mixin for the media queries. I also used a negative margin for the images on the left and right borders of the page and had to use an overflow-x hidden to solve the scrollbar showing on mobile.

### Continued development

Still working on flex box and want to add css grid in future projects. my code is better organized, but I plan are using partials to organize it even better into separate files.
